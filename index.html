                Hi there! My name is Tamariah Davis. I am currently a junior studying Information Analysis at the University of Michigan. In summer of 2020, I was a Business System Analyst Intern at University of Michigan Information and Technology Services. Currently, I hold multiple positions as; Social Media and Marketing chair with Support for Incoming Black Students (SIBS), Treasurer for National Society of Black Engineers (NSBE), and Marketing and Media Intern for the Comprehensive Studies Program. Being in these roles allowed me to understand the power of digital media as a tool for community development.
